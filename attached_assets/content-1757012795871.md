![Fi MCP Beta Logo](https://fi.money/assets/wealth-mcp/svgs/fi-mcp-logo.svg)

For developers who want complete control over their financial data. If you're someone who automates their life, lives off Notion dashboards, or tracks every rupee on Excel, then the Fi MCP (beta) is built for you.

![Fi MCP Dashboard Preview](https://fi.money/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffi.money%2Fassets%2Fwealth-mcp%2Fwebp%2Ffi-mcp-getting-started.webp&w=1920&q=75)

## What is Fi MCP?

At its core, Fi MCP (beta) is a secure, structured, and query-ready live stream of your financial data. Tailor-made for developers, Fi Model Context Protocol or Fi MCP is essentially a programmable layer over your entire net worth, powered by Fi Money's Net Worth feature.

Instead of static dashboards or fragmented insights, Fi MCP gives you a unified, real-time view across:

- Assets: Mutual Funds, Indian & US Stocks, FDs, Real Estate, ESOPs
- Liabilities: Loans (home, personal, etc.), Credit Cards
- Cash: Bank Balances
- Govt Instruments: EPF, NPS

## What can you do with Fi MCP?

Once connected, your AI assistant or local tool can act as a programmable portfolio analyst, helping you:

- Track portfolio performance over time (CAGR, XIRR, YTD)
- Identify underperforming funds
- Flag financial leakages like excess interest outflows, idle cash, or high expense ratios
- Compare returns across asset classes (e.g., Mutual Funds vs. US Stocks)
- Simulate progress toward goals (e.g., reaching ₹1 crore by 2032)

## How to set up Fi MCP

### Step 1: Start by downloading the Fi Money app

Once you download the Fi Money app, head to the Net Worth Tracker tab. Link all your accounts like mutual funds, bank balances, loans, PFs, and more. This powers Fi MCP (beta) with real-time access to your complete financial picture, allowing it to compute your current net worth accurately.

### Step 2: Install a compatible MCP client

You can use any client that supports local config files and command-line integration. Make sure that the AI assistant is the latest desktop version.

- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- Windsurf

### Step 3: Add Fi MCP to your config

**For setting up Fi MCP on Claude (Desktop):**

**Prerequisite: Install Node.js**

- Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing node –version
- Type in the command **_npm install npx_** to install npx

Go to your Claude's settings:

Settings > Developer > Add/Edit Config

Paste the following:

{

mcpServers: {

fi\_mcp: {

command: npx,

args: \[mcp-remote, https://mcp.fi.money:8080/mcp/stream\]

    }

}

Save and restart the client app.

**For setting up Fi MCP on Cursor or Windsurf (Desktop):**

Go to your settings:

Settings > Tools & Integrations > Add Custom MCP

Paste the following:

{

mcpServers: {

fi\_mcp: {

url: https://mcp.fi.money:8080/mcp/stream

    }

}

}

Auto save or Ctrl+S for Windows (Command+S for Mac) and restart the AI assistant.

### Step 4: Ask your first question

Try:

- "How has my net worth changed over the past 6 months?"
- "Which fund is my worst performer in 2024?"

The AI assistant will now request a Passcode to authenticate your data access.

Click on the Login link and enter your Fi-registered phone number on the web page.

### Step 5: Get Passcode from Fi

Open Fi Money app again.

Navigate to Net Worth Dashboard > Talk to AI > Get Passcode

Copy the Passcode and enter it in your client window. Once verified, enter "Done" for the client to authenticate you.

### Step 6: Start running queries on your finances like an API

- "How do I increase my credit score to 800?"
- "What are the 3 mistakes that I'm doing with my investments?"
- "Where am I losing money unnecessarily?"

Your AI assistant now speaks the language of your finances, which is powered by real-time, personalised data. It now gives you intelligent, personalised responses–grounded in your actual, up-to-date net worth.

## How Fi MCP Keeps Your Data Secure

Fi MCP (beta) is built with security and control at its core. You own your financial data, completely. You decide which accounts to connect, what gets shared, how it's used, and which AI assistant to connect to. Fi MCP (beta) only accesses the financial information you explicitly link through the Fi app, and nothing more.

Your credentials are never exposed to any AI assistant or stored externally; all authentication happens securely within the Fi app via two-factor authentication (TFA). Even token-based (Passcode) access has a strict 30-minute expiry, ensuring session-level safety.

What you get therefore is a consolidated, real-time view of your net worth, built on a system that puts you in charge–with privacy, transparency, and access control at every step.

## Why does Fi MCP matter?

Almost every other personal finance tool has been read-only until now. The Fi MCP (beta) changes the game.

As India's first personal finance MCP, it makes your finances queryable, context-aware, and composable with the developer tools you already use. It's easy to use, seamless, and answers your most pertinent financial questions in under 180 seconds!

Additionally, Fi MCP (beta) is a mighty leap forward for anyone looking to:

- Automate financial alerts
- Run real-time simulations
- Set intelligent money triggers
- Build personalised dashboards

The future of personal finance is programmable. And it starts with Fi MCP.

Whether you're a developer, power user, or automation enthusiast, Fi MCP gives you the tools to treat your money like a live data stream–not a static report. With full control, secure access, and seamless AI integration, it's not just about tracking your finances; it's about engineering your financial future.

Ready to talk to your money? Fi MCP is waiting.

assistant receives a temporary token to access the financial data. This token is short-lived and invalidated
automatically after a brief period of time.


Additionally, we regularly conduct independent security audits and third-party penetration tests to proactively
identify security issues, validate security
controls, and ensure the highest security standards for our application and infrastructure.
